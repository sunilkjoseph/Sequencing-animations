# Sequencing Animations Project

This project demonstrates how to sequence animations on a web page using the Web Animations API. The animations are applied to a set of images, creating a sequential effect.

## Overview

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`main.js`). The goal is to animate three images in a specific sequence, with each image animating after the previous one has finished.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that includes the structure of the web page with three images.

- **style.css:** The CSS file containing styles for the page layout.

- **main.js:** The JavaScript file where animations are defined and applied using the Web Animations API.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the sequenced animations.

## Animation Sequence

The animations are defined using the Web Animations API and applied to the images in the following sequence:

1. The first image (`alice1`) is animated initially.

2. After the first animation finishes, the second image (`alice2`) is animated.

3. After the second animation finishes, the third image (`alice3`) is animated.
